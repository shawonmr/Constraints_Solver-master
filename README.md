# Constraints_Solver-master
 This is a genetic algorithm solution for high dimensional, complex constraint solver. 
The genetic algorithm has all of its features implemented in genetic.py file. A sample description of the genetic algorithm that has been followed here: https://towardsdatascience.com/genetic-algorithm-implementation-in-python-5ab67bb124a6 In case of fitness calculation of the population, the constraint.py has been used that actually counts the number of given constriants the population solves.
